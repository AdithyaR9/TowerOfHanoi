This is the classic Tower of Hanoi Game that implements a Stack. 

-> The movements for the game must be done with keys 1, 2 and 3.

Here are the rules of the game:
- Only one disk may be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the top disk from one of the rods and placing it onto another rod.
- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk

Note: When using the program, put all the files into a singular folder for proper functionality and to avoid accessibility errors (game implements stack interface)
